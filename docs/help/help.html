      <p>For a programming project the computer is set up in the same way as if any text
         editor is used for coding and the tested program would be run from a command
         prompt. This may also mean to set environment variables. Presently, programming
         projects can be defined for Java, R and Perl.
      </p>
      <p>
         To compile Java files by simply clicking the 'compile' button or selecting the
         corresponding option in the menu (as opposed to using the command prompt of the
         OS or the option to start system commands in the program) it must be made sure
         that the program is run using the Java Runtime environment (JRE) contained in
         the Java Development Kit (JDK).

      <!--Project-->
      <h2 id="Projects">Working with projects</h2>
      <p>Assigning a 'project' initially just means the notification of a working
         directory (project root). This defines which files belong to a (currently
         active) project and it defines the working directory where commands are
         executed. The required or optional input for setting up a project depends
         on the project category.

      <h4 id="Config">Assign files as project</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>Open a file from or save a new file to the directory that is the presumed root
          directory of the project. The file may also be saved in a sub-directory path
          contained in that root.</li>
      <li>While a file that is presumed to be part of the project is viewed in the editor open
          the project settings window by selecting 'Project' > 'Assign as project'. The input
          options shown in the settings window depend on the project category.</li>
      <li>Enter the name of the presumed root directory of the project in the text field
          'Name of project root'. If the project category is 'Generic' or 'HTML' go to
          step 7.</li>
      <li>Enter the name of the main source file in the corresponding text field (this
          applies to Java, R, and Perl). The main file does not have to be the currently
          selected file and even not be opened but must exist.</li>
      <li>If source files (or packages in the case of a Java project) are saved in a
          separate sub-directory of the presumed root of the project the name of this
          directory must be entered in the field 'Name of sources directory'.</li>
      <li>The name of a separate destination directory for compiled files (applies to
          Java) maybe entered in the field 'Name of executables directory'. This folder
          will be created in the project's root directory when source files are compiled
          by clicking the 'compile' button or selecting the corresponding option in the
          menu.</li>
      <li>Click ok. If entries are correct, that is the named project root matches the
          name of an existing directory (for Generic and HTML) and this root also contains
          the named main source file (for Java, Perl and R), the files in the project can be
          viewed in the 'Project explorer'. This is opened by selecting 'View' > 'Project
          explorer'.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>

      <h4 id="ChangeProjects">Changing between projects</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>'Project' > 'Assign as project' is selected to assign an additional project.
          The file that is supposed to be part of the new project must be in the
          selected tab.</li>
      <li>Changing between already set projects is done by selecting a file that is part of
          the project to be set active and then selecting 'Project' > 'Change project' or,
          to additionally view or modify the settings, 'Project' > 'Project settings'.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h4 id="Retrieve">Retrieving projects</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>The project that was active when the program was closed the last time is retrieved
          and set active when a file of that project is opened (or a new file is saved to
          that project) and no other project is already active.</li>
      <li>If 'Save settings to "eadproject" file" in the project folder' is selected in the
          settings window the parameters for the project are stored in the project folder.
          The file can be deleted at any time by unselecting the option to save it.<br>
          This properties file marks a project as an "Eadgyth project". If a file of a
          marked project is opened (or a new file is saved to that project) the project is
          set active even if it was not active lastly. Also, if another project is already
          active, a marked project is loaded and can be set active by selecting 'Project' >
          'Change project'.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="TestingCode">Testing source code</h2>

      <h4 id="JavaProject">Testing Java code and creating a jar file</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>Compile the source file(s) by selecting 'Save all open project files and compile
          project' in the 'Project' menu or by clicking the corresponding button in the toolbar.
          Note that presently files outside of the source root cannot be included in a compilation
          when the preset option to compile a project is used.</li>
      <li>To include warnings -Xlint compiler options may be specified. The input field for the
          -Xlint option is found in the 'Project settings' dialog in the tab 'Compilation and
          build'.</li>
      <li>The Java program can be run for testing by selecting 'Run' in the 'Project' menu or by
          clicking the run button in the toolbar. The output and error messages from the tested
          program are displayed in the text area of the console. A tested program can be forcibly
          quit by clicking the 'stop' symbol in the tool bar of the console panel.</li>
      <li>Arguments (those that would be passed to the main method) may be entered in the input
          field 'Arguments' which is found in the 'Project settings' dialog in the tab 'Run'.</li>
      <li>An executable java archive (jar) may be created by selecting 'Project' > 'Create jar'.
          The jar file is saved in the executables folder or, if no such folder is available, in
          the project's root folder. A name for the jar file can be specified in the 'Project
          settings' dialog in the tab 'Compilation and build' If no name is specified the name of
          the main class is used.</li>
      <li>Files other than .java files and .class files can be included in compilation and a jar,
          resepctively. The extensions of included files are specified in the text field 'Extensions
          of included non-Java files' in the 'Project settings' dialog in the tab 'Compilation and
          build'. Extensions can be separeted by spaces, commas or semicolons and must begin with
          the period. Including non-Java files is supported only if the project contains separate
          directories for source files (where also the non-Java files must be found) and for .class
          files.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>

      <h4 id="PerlProject">Testing a Perl script</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>Save changes to the Perl script and select 'Run' in the 'Project' menu.
      </li>
      <li>Any output (error) is shown in the console panel.<br> NOTE: there is a limitation when the
          script asks for input through a command line. In that case any output from the script
          expected before the input is asked for (like "Enter your name:") is only printed after all
          inputs were made. However, the output would be shown as expected if the autoflushing of
          Perl's STDOUT is turned on in the script itself. A way to do this (for testing purposes)
          is to begin the script with the line "STDOUT->autoflush(1);". The other possibilty is, of
          course, to start the command-line/terminal of the OS to test the script (see
          <a href="#Console">Using the console</a>).</li>
      <li>Arguments (those that are used as command-line arguments) may be entered in the text field
         'Arguments' (separated by spaces) in the settings window ('Project' > 'Project settings').
      </li>
      </ol>
      <br>

      <h4 id="RProject">Testing an R script</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>Save changes to the script and select 'Run' in the 'Project' menu. Internally, the script
          is started using the "Rscript" command.</li>
      <li>Options for a start command (those that are used as command-line options) may be entered in
          the text field 'Start options' in the settings window ('Project' > 'Project settings').</li>
      <li>Arguments (those that are used as command-line arguments) may be entered in the text field
         'Arguments' (separated by spaces) in the settings window.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>

      <h4 id="HtmlProject">Viewing HTML code in a web browser</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>Save changes to the selected html file and select 'Run' in the 'Project' menu to view the
          html file in the default web browser. The html file must be selected.
      </li>
      </ol>

      <!--Console-->
      <h2 id="Console">Using the console</h2>
      <p>The console area shall show messages after compilation of a project and the output of a
         program that is tested.</p>
      <p>In addition, self-chosen system commands entered in a dialog can be run in the current
         working directory (the project's root directory).</p>
      <p>A run process can be forcibly quit by clicking the 'stop' symbol.</p>
      <p>The console does not emulate the terminal of the operating system! However, it is possible
         (or rather not prohibited) to run the system's terminal in the console by running the
         command that starts the terminal (e.g., cmd.exe in Windows). It is important to note that
         a tested program thereupon started from this terminal CANNOT be forcibly quit by clicking
         the 'stop' symbol.</p>
      <p>Hint: using the command to start "THE" terminal window (in Windows this would be cmd.exe
         /c start) presets the working directory for the terminal to the project's root directory.</p>

      <h4>To run a system command...</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>Open the console panel in the menu 'View' > 'Console'.
      </li>
      <li>Press the button 'Cmd...' and enter a command in the shown dialog window. Click ok in
          the dialog window to run the command.
      </li>
      <li>To run a previous command press the '>' button; to change a command open the command
          dialog again by clicking 'Cmd...'.
      </li>
      </ol>

      <p><a href="#ancor">Back to top</a></p>

      <!--File explorer-->
      <h2 id="Explorer">Using the project explorer</h2>
      <p>The project explorer is opened by selecting 'View' > 'Project explorer'. It shows the file
         system of a project once one is assigned.<br>
         The explorer always shows the project that is currently set active. A few operations are
         supported:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The project's file system is shown as a tree in which folders are expanded or shrunk by
          clicking the (+), (-) handles, as usual. However, a double left click on a folder symbol
          does not expand/shrink the folder but displays a new tree rooted at the clicked folder.
          To move back the 'Folder up' symbol is clicked. The topmost level is always the project's
          root directory.
      </li>
      <li>A double left click on a file opens the clicked file in a new tab.
      </li>
      <li>A file may be deleted after a right click on a file symbol and selecting'delete'. If the
          deleted file is in an open tab, the tab is not closed but goes into "Save as" mode.
      </li>
      <li>A folder may be as well deleted after a right click on a folder symbol but a folder is
          protected from deletion if it is not empty. The exception is, if present, the folder for
          executable files or its subfolders. This may be deleted for a completely renewed
          compilation.
      </li>
      <li>A new folder may be created after a right click on a folder symbol and selecting
         'Create new folder'.
      </li>
      <li>Changes to the project's file structure made from within the program should be updated
          in the file view. Changes made from outside the program would be updated
          "manually" by clicking the 'refresh' symbol.
      </li>
      </ul>
