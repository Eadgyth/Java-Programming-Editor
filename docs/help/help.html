      <p>For a programming project the computer is set up in the same way as if any text
         editor (like Notepad) is used for coding and the tested program would be run
         from the command-line interface of the OS. This may also mean to set environment
         variables for the used programming language.
      </p>
      <p>To compile Java files by the pre-defined compile option (as opposed to using the
         command-line interface of the OS or the option to start system commands in the
         console of the program) it must be made sure that the program is run using the
         Java Runtime environment (JRE) contained in the Java Development Kit (JDK).

      <h2 id="Projects">Working with projects</h2>
      <h4>What is a project?</h4>
      <p>A project is initially just a working directory which distinguishes
         "project files" from "non-project files" and which defines the directory
         where commands are executed. The required or optional settings for a
         project depend on the <a href="#Categories"> project category</a>. The
         program sets commands to run code after a project has been successfully
         assigned. However, setting up a project requires existing (source) files.
      </p>
      <br>
      
      <h4>Assigning files as project</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>Open a file from or save a new file to the directory that is the presumed root
          directory of the project. The file may also be saved in a sub-directory or a
          sub-directory path contained in that root. Assigning a project only requires
          that a (any) file that is contained in the project directory is open and also
          is in the selected tab if multiple files are open.</li>
      <li>Open the project settings window by selecting 'Assign as project' in the
          'Project' menu and choosing a project category. The input options in the
          settings window depend on the project category. The required entries are the
          name of the project root directory and the name of the main file/script that is
          executed when the project is run (the latter not asked for in an HTML project
          and also not in a 'generic' project). In addition, it may be possible that
          source files are stored in a separate sub-directory of the project root (a
          source folder). In this case the name of this directory is specified in the
          input field 'Name of sources directory'. For Java this directory must not be
          a directory that is a package.</li>
      <li>Make the required entries in the input field(s) and click ok.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>

      <h4>Adding projects and changing between projects</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>'Assign as project' in the 'Project' menu may be selected to assign an additional
          project. For this a file that is part of the new project must be currently
          open and also in the selected tab if multiple files are open.</li>
      <li>Changing between already set projects is done by selecting, opening or saving a
          file that is part of the project to be changed to and then selecting 'Change
          project' in the 'Project' menu or clicking the corresponding button in the
          toolbar.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h4>Retrieving projects</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>The project that was active when the program was closed the last time is
          retrieved and set active when a file of the project is opened (or a new
          file is saved to the project) and no other project is already active. Also,
          the recent project is shown in the project explorer.</li>
      <li>If 'Save ProjConfig file in the project' is selected in the project settings
          the parameters for the project are stored in the project folder. This
          properties file can be deleted at any time by unselecting the option to save
          it.<br>
          A project is marked as such by the presence the ProjConfig file. This means
          that a project is loaded even if it was not active lastly or other projects
          are already active. Loading the project again takes place if a file of the
          project is opened (or a new file is saved to the project). If another project
          is already active, it is asked to change to the newly loaded project.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="JavaProject">Java</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>To run a Java program first compile the source file(s) by selecting 'Save
          and compile project' in the 'Project' menu. If it is specified to save
          compiled class files in a separate sub-directory of the project directory
          in the project settings this folder may be deleted in the project explorer
          for a renewed compilation. If the compilation was successful the Java
          program is started by selecting 'Run project'.</li>
      <li>An executable java archive (jar) may be created by selecting 'Create jar' in
          the project menu. A name for the jar file can be specified in the tab
          'Compilation and build' in the project settings. The jar is saved in the
          project directory unless a pathname is specified to save it to another
          location. This path may be relative to the project directory or also a full
          path to save the jar to a directory outside the project directory.</li>
      <li>Files other than .java files and .class files can be included in a compilation
          and a jar, resepctively. Extensions of included files are specified with the
          beginning period in the input field 'Extensions of included non-Java files'
          which is found in the tab 'Compilation and build' in the project settings.</li>
      <li>Libraries may be specified in the tab 'Libraries' in the project settings.
          These are added in classpath and can be folders containing class files or
          jar files. Classpath can be a path relative to the project directory (e.g.
          libs/some.jar given this file exists in the project directory) but also an
          absolute path. When the program is packaged in a jar the paths are added to
          the CLASS-PATH header in the manifest file as specified.</li>          
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h4 id="PerlProject">Perl</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>A Perl script is started by selecting 'Save and run project'.</li>
      <li>The Perl script may be checked for correct syntax without running it by
          by selecting 'Save and compile project' (this starts the script with the -c
          option).</li>  
      <li>NOTE: For correct output of a Perl program to the console window it may be
          necessary to turn of buffering of the standard output in the script (e.g. by
          adding $| = 1 at the beginning of the script).</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h4 id="PythonProject">Python</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>A Python script is started by selecting 'Save and run project'.</li>
      <li>NOTE: For correct output of a Python program to the console window it may be
          necessary to specify a command option that turns off buffering of the standard
          output and standerd error (-u).</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h4 id="RProject">R</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>An R script is started by selecting 'Save and run project'. The script is run
          by using the Rscript command.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h4 id="HtmlProject">HTML</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>An HTML file is viewed in the default browser by selecting 'Save and run project'.
          Any HTML file that is located in the project directory can be viewed. The viewed
          file is the currently open file or the file in the selected tab if multiple files
          are open.</li>

      <!--Console-->
      <h2 id="Console">Using the console</h2>
      <p>The console shall show messages after compiling a project (applies to Java) and
         the (error) output of a program that is tested.</p>
      <p>In addition, self-chosen system commands entered in a dialog can be run in the
         current working directory (the project directory).</p>
      <p>A run process can be forcibly quit by clicking the 'stop' symbol.</p>
      <p>NOTE: The console does not emulate the terminal of the operating system!
         However, it is possible (or rather not prohibited) to run the system's terminal
         in the console by running the command that starts the terminal (e.g., cmd.exe in
         Windows). It is important to note that a tested program thereupon started from
         this terminal CANNOT be forcibly quit by clicking the 'stop' symbol as this
         would only end the terminal.</p>
      <h4>To run a system command...</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>Open the console panel by selecting 'Console' in the View menu.</li>
      <li>Press the button 'Cmd...' and enter a command in the shown dialog window. Click
          ok to run the command.</li>
      <li>To run a previous command press the run button button (in the tool bar of the
          console; to change a command open the command dialog again by clicking 'Cmd...'.
      </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Hints</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>Using the command to start "THE" terminal window (in Windows this would be
          cmd.exe /c start) presets the working directory for the terminal to the
          project directory. To run a program in the CMD (again Windows) and keep the
          CMD open the command would be cmd.exe /c start cmd /k [command].</li>
      <li>The option to enter commands may be used to run batch files saved in the
          working directory (in Windows the command would be cmd.exe /c [BatchFile.bat]).
      </li>
      </ul>
