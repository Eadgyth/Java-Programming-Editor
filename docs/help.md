<p>For a programming project the computer is set up in the same way as if any text
   editor (like Notepad) is used for coding and the tested program would be run
   from the command-line interface of the OS. This may also mean to set environment
   variables. Presently, programming projects can be defined for Java, R and Perl.
</p>
<p>To compile Java files by the pre-defined compile option (as opposed to using the
   command-line interface of the OS or the option to start system commands in the
   console of the program) it must be made sure that the program is run using the
   Java Runtime environment (JRE) contained in the Java Development Kit (JDK).
