<h3>How to set up the editor to run code?</h3>
The program is set up for running source code by creating a "project". This is initially
just a working directory which distinguishes "project files" from "non-project files" and
which defines the directory where commands (built-in or self defined) are executed. Setting
a project (or changing to another project, see below) requires that a file that is
part of the project is open and also in the selected tab if multiple files are open. This
can be any file and does not even have to be a source file. It may also be found in a
sub-directory path relative to the project directory.
