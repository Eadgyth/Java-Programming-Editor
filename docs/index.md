I started to make this text editor when I started to learn Java for
myself and wished that NotePad had a compile and a run button. I am
still learning and struggling ...

A goal is that it is as simple as possible to set up the editor to
to try out code by the built-in functions. There should be at the same
time some flexibility. For example, if I want to run my first 'Hello
World' program it's only nessecary to give the editor the name of
the Java file and the name of the directory where this file is found.
It is also possible to run a real Java project with apackage strucure
and also separate directories for sources and compiled class files.
The languages for which the 'run' function is built-in are rather
limited now and are more there to demonstrate that the program can
be extended to support other languages (or kind of project category).
