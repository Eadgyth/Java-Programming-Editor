<h2>Features</h2>
<h4>Text editing</h4>
<ul>
<li>Working with several open files in tabs. The tabbar may be hidden to work
    with a single document.</li>
<li>Enabling and disabling word-wrapping (word-wrapping not in combination with
    line-numbering, however).</li>
<li>Undo/redo.</li>
<li>A basic find/replace function.</li>
<li>Clearing end-of-line (trailing) white spaces.</li>
<li>An "exchange editor" pane to edit text in a separate view and to facilitate
    the exchange of text within a file or between files.</li>
<li>A basic syntax highlighting (for Java, Perl, R, HTML, XML, CSS, Javascript).</li>
<li>A basic auto-indentation.</li>
<li>Block-wise increase or decrease of the indentation.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Testing source code</h4>
<ul>
<li>An easy assignment of files as project and setting of parameters for a
   project.</li>
   <ul>
   <li>A project may be simply the location of (source) files.</li>
   <li>The program can work with a given directory structure of a project,
       that is folders for source files or for executable files. Also
       packages are taken into account in a Java project.</li>
   <li>A number of projects can be assigned which can be switch between.</li>
   <li>Retrieval of already defined projects after newly starting the program.</li>
   </ul>
<li>Pre-defined actions to run (or compile/build) a project.</li>
   <ul>
   <li>Compiling/testing Java code and bundling a Java program in an executable
       jar file.</li>
   <li>Testing a Perl script.</li>
   <li>Testing an R script.</li>
   <li>Viewing Html code in the default web browser.</li>
   </ul>
<li>A basic console to view the output and error messages after compiling a Java
    program or during testing a Java, R or Perl program. If the tested program asks
    for input this can be entered in the text area of the console (for a limitation
    when an interactive Perl script is tested see
    <a href="help/help.html#PerlProject">Testing a Perl script</a>.</li>
<li>Running self-chosen system commands in the current working directory. The output
    of the process is shown in the console area. Such commands may be used for actions
    that are not pre-defined in a project category. Also a generic project without
    any pre-defined actions and dependency on a certain file type may be assigned to
    run system commands in the project directory.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Other</h4>
<ul>
<li>A file explorer for the project that is set active</li>
</ul>
