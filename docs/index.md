I started to make a text editor when I started to learn Java for myself and wished that NotePad
had a compile and a run button. I knew that really versatile code editors and IDEs exist but
using them seemed very complicated for me …

A goal is that it is as simple as possible to set up the editor to try out code by using
built-in functions and provide at the same time some flexibility to run a real little coding
project. The number of languages for which a ‘run’ function is built-in is limited so far
(Java, Perl, R, Python and HTML) but the code for the program is somewhat easily extensible
to add support for other languages. A "generic" project may be set as well. Here a system
command can be specified, for example to run a batch file in a given project directory.

The github repository for the program also contains, well ... "releases" (a record of my
attempts to reduce mistakes). Anyway, these include an executable jar file of the program
for trying it.

<h3>How to set up Eadgyth to run code?</h3>
The program is set up for running source code by setting a "project". This is initially
just a working directory which distinguishes "project files" from "non-project files" and
which defines the directory where commands (built-in or self defined) are executed. Setting
a project (or changing to another already set project) requires that any file that is
part of the project is open and also in the selected tab if multiple files are open. This
file may also be found in a sub-directory path relative to the project directory.

Here is an example for a 'Hello World' program in Java. The 'Hello World' program was saved as
HelloWorld.java in a directory named helloworld. The project settings are opened by selecting
'Open settings for...' and choosing the category Java:

In the project settings the name of the project directory and the name of the Java file are
entered. The other two fields remain emtpy because HelloWorld.java is not saved in separate
sub-directory for sources and the distination for the compiled class file (next step) is
just the project directory:

<img src="images/projectsettings.png" width="600"/>


After setting the project files can be viewed in the 'Project explorer'. It is also checked
to save the configuration to be able to reload the project when HelloWorld.java is opened after
newly starting the editor (a project is reloaded after opening any file in a project directory
that was specified previously). Then it is tried to compile the program. However, the console
panel that opened shows errors:

After correcting the code a new compilation generates the class file HelloWorld.class and the
program can be run:

<img src="images/run.png" width="600"/>
