         <h2>Features</h2>
         <h4>Text editing</h4>
         <ul>
         <li>Working with several open files in tabs. The tabbar may be hidden to work
             with a single document.</li>
         <li>Enabling and disabling word-wrapping (word-wrapping not in combination with
             line-numbering, however).</li>
         <li>Undo/redo including the undoing of a "replace all" action.</li>
         <li>A basic find/replace function.</li>
         <li>Clearing end-of-line (trailing) white spaces.</li>
         <li>An "exchange editor" pane to edit text in a separate view and to facilitate
             the exchange of text within a file or between files</li>
         <li>A basic syntax highlighting for Java, Perl, R, HTML, Javascript and CSS
             (not quite perfect, especially not HTML).</li>
         <li>A basic auto-indentation.</li>
         <li>Block-wise increase or decrease of the indentation.</li>
         </ul>
         <h4>Testing source code</h4>
         <ul>
         <li>A simple and flexible assignment of files as project.</li>
            <ul>
            <li>A project may be simply the location of (source) files.</li>
            <li>The program also works with a given directory structure of a project.
                This may include folders for source files or for executable files.
                Also packages and sub-packages are taken into account in a Java project.</li>
            <li>A number of projects can be assigned and one can easily switch between
                projects.</li>
            <li>Retrieval of already defined projects after newly starting the program.</li>
            </ul>
         <li>Pre-defined actions in a project by simply using menu selections or buttons.</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Compiling/testing Java code and bundling a Java program in an executable
                jar file. Non-Java files may be included in a compilation and in a jar.</li>
            <li>Testing a Perl script.</li>
            <li>Testing an R script.</li>
            <li>Viewing Html code in the default web browser.</li>
            </ul>
         <li>A basic console to view the output and error messages after compiling a Java
             program or during testing a Java, R or Perl program. If the tested program asks
             for input this can be entered in the text area of the console (for a limitation
             when an interactive Perl script is tested see
             <a href="help/help.html#PerlProject">Testing a Perl script</a>.</li>
         <li>Running self-chosen system commands in the current working directory. The output
             of the process is shown in the console area. Such commands may be used for actions
             that are not pre-defined in a project category. Also a generic project without any
             pre-defined actions may be assigned</li>
         </ul>
         <h4>Other</h4>
         <ul>
           <li>A file explorer that shows the files of the project that is set active.
               It offers to open files, delete files and to create directories</i>
         </ul>
