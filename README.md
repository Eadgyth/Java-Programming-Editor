This is a text editor, written in Java, which can be used for programming. A programming
project can be easily set to use built-in functions to run an application for testing. Also,
several projects, which can be switched between, can be set in parallel. Project categories
so far are Java, Perl, Python, R and HTML. Also, a "generic" project may be defined to run
self-chosen system commands. The program includes a basic console, a file explorer and a basic
syntax highlighting.

DOCUMENTATION<br>
A more detailed description of the features, screenshots, a help site and code documentation
can be found under <a href="https://eadgyth.github.io/Programming-Editor/">here</a>.

REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING<br>
Running and compiling the program requires Java 8 or higher. The executable jar file in the
folder 'JarAndPreferences' was made after compilation with JDK 8 and by using the Java
Archive Tool in the JDK.
<p>
If the program shall be used for compiling Java code by the built-in compile option it must be
made sure that the program is run using the JRE contained in the JDK (and not the public JRE).
<p>
For using the built-in function to run code the path variables that point to the executables
of a programming language may have to be set in the OS (they have to under Windows).
<p>
LIMITATIONS<br>
Among the countless limitations some need mention:
<ul>
<li>The editor includes a basic console to show output/error messages from a tested program
    or also freely defined system commands. This console is in principle interactive but
    interaction may not work in all cases. Specifically, the output of processes that buffer
    the standard output is not shown interactively but only after the process ended. Therefore,
    buffering would have to be disabled, for example, by specifying a corresponding command
    option, if available for a given language/process.</li>
<li>The compilation of java files and the creation of an executable jar file cannot include
    external libraries if the built-in options for compiling and crating a jar are selected.</li>
<li>I tested the program on Windows. There are some problems with the graphical appearance
    on a high dpi screen. I would be grateful for feedback, especially from somebody who may
    have tried it on other platforms (m.bussiek@web.de).</li>
