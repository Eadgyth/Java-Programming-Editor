<h4>GOAL</h4>
<p>
A text editor which can be used for coding and which can be easily set up to run code for
testing by built-in functions. The editor should remain as simple as possible and be
useful, for example, to write applications for home requirements or quick testing.

<h4>SHORT DESCRIPTION</h4>
<p>
To use built-in functions for running code a file is opened or newly saved and a project
is defined by selecting a project category from the 'Project' menu. This opens a simple
settings dialog. Project categories so far are Java, Perl, Python, R and HTML.
<p>
The program allows to set several projects in parallel and projects can be retrieved after
a new start.

<h4>DOCUMENTATION</h4>
<p>
A more detailed description of the features, screenshots, a help site and code documentation
can be found <a href="https://eadgyth.github.io/Programming-Editor/">here</a>.

<h4>REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING</h4>
<p>
Running and compiling the program requires Java 8 or higher. The executable jar file in the
folder 'JarAndPreferences' was made after compilation with JDK 8. Compiling and building a
jar of the program can be done with this editor itself or by creating a Java project with
existing sources in Netbeans (using the src folder in the repository). Compiling with a Java
version higher than 8 is possible too but some causes for compiler warnings are not yet
removed.
<p>
If the program shall be used for compiling Java code by the built-in compile option it must be
made sure that the program is run using the JRE contained in the JDK (and not the public JRE).
<p>
For using the built-in function to run code the path variables that point to the executables
of a programming language may have to be set in the OS (they have to under Windows).

<h4>LIMITATIONS</h4>
<p>
The editor includes a basic console to show output/error messages from a tested program
or also from freely defined system commands. This console is interactive (input can be
entered) but interaction does not work properly in the case that a process buffers all
the output until completion if it is not to the terminal of the OS. Therefore output
may be unexpected. This can be checked by disabling block-buffering (or enabling line
buffering) if this option is available for a language (a command option or a switch in
a script itself).
<p>
The compilation of java files and the creation of an executable jar file cannot include
external libraries if the built-in options for compiling and creating a jar are selected.
<p>
I tested the program on Windows. There are some problems with the graphical appearance
on a high dpi screen. I would be grateful for feedback, especially from somebody who may
have tried it on other platforms (m.bussiek@web.de).

<h4>ACKLOWLEDGEMENT</h4>
