<h3>Eadgyth Programming-Editor</h3>
<p>
A text editor which can be used for coding and which can be easily set up to run code for
testing. The goal is an editor that is as simple as possible to use and is helpful, for
example, to write applications for home requirements.
<br>
<p>
A more detailed description of the features, screenshots, a help site and code documentation
can be found <a href="https://eadgyth.github.io/Programming-Editor/">here</a>.
<p> 
To try the program the executable jar file in a
<a href="https://github.com/Eadgyth/Programming-Editor/releases">release</a> may be used.
<br>
<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>
<p>
Running and compiling the program requires Java 8 or higher. Building an executable jar
file can be done by creating a Java project with existing sources in Netbeans using the
src folder from the repository as sources directory.
<p>
If this editor shall be used for compiling Java code by the built-in compile option it must
be made sure that it is run using the JRE contained in the JDK (and not the public JRE).
<p>
For using the built-in function to run code the path variables that point to the executables
of a programming language may have to be set in the OS (they have to under Windows).
<br>
<h4>LIMITATIONS</h4>
<p>
The editor includes a basic console to show output/error messages from a tested program
or from freely defined system commands. This console is interactive but interaction does
not work properly if a process buffers all the output until completion in the case that
output is not to the terminal of the OS (PERL, for example, but not Java). To display
output correctly block-buffering would have to be disabled if this option is available
for a language (by a corresponding command option which can be entered in the project
settings or by a switch in a script itself). Also, an application may be tested by starting
it in the terminal of the OS using the option to enter system commands.
<p>
If the built-in options to compile a Java project and to create a jar from it are used only
sources found in the project directory (or a sources sub-directory if given) are compiled.
Inclusion of external libraries is so far not supported.

<h4>ACKLOWLEDGEMENT</h4>
<p>
The program uses icons from
<a href="https://github.com/Distrotech/tango-icon-theme">Tango Desktop Project</a>.
