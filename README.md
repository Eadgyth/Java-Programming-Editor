<h4>GOAL</h4>
<p>
A text editor which can be used for coding and which can be easily set up to run code for
testing. The editor should be as simple as possible to use and be helpful, for example, to
write applications for home requirements or quick testing.
<br>
<h4>SHORT DESCRIPTION</h4>
<p>
To run code a file is first opened or newly saved. While the file is open (and selected in
the tab bar) a project is assigned by selecting a project category from the 'Project' menu.
This opens a simple settings dialog. Project categories so far are Java, Perl, Python, R and
HTML.
<p>
The program allows to set several projects in parallel. Switching between set projects can be
done after selecting a file that is part of the project to change to.

<h4>DOCUMENTATION</h4>
<p>
A more detailed description of the features, screenshots, a help site and code documentation
can be found <a href="https://eadgyth.github.io/Programming-Editor/">here</a>.
<br>
<h4>REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING</h4>
<p>
Running and compiling the program requires Java 8 or higher. The executable jar file in the
folder 'JarAndPreferences' was made after compilation with JDK 8. Compiling and building a
jar of the program can be done with this editor itself or by creating a Java project with
existing sources in Netbeans (using the src folder in the repository). Compiling with a Java
version higher than 8 is possible too but some causes for compiler warnings are not yet
removed.
<p>
If the program shall be used for compiling Java code by the built-in compile option it must be
made sure that the program is run using the JRE contained in the JDK (and not the public JRE).
<p>
For using the built-in function to run code the path variables that point to the executables
of a programming language may have to be set in the OS (they have to under Windows).
<br>
<h4>LIMITATIONS</h4>
<p>
The editor includes a basic console to show output/error messages from a tested program
or also from freely defined system commands. This console is interactive (input can be
entered) but interaction does not work properly in the case that a process buffers all
the output until completion if it is not to the terminal of the OS. Therefore output
may be unexpected. This can be checked by disabling block-buffering (or enabling line
buffering) if this option is available for a language (a command option or a switch in
a script itself).
<p>
If the built-in options to compile a Java project and to create a jar from it are used only
sources found in the project directory (or a sources sub-directory) are compiled. The
sources may be oganized in packages/sub-packages and it is possibel to include non-Java files.
However, inclusion of external libraries is so far not supported.
<p>
I tested the program on Windows. There are some problems with the graphical appearance
on a high dpi screen. I would be grateful for feedback, especially from somebody who may
have tried it on other platforms (m.bussiek@web.de).
