<p>Eadgyth is a simple source code text editor with a built-in possibility to compile java
code and to run code written in Java, Perl and R for testing. It is written in Java.
<p>
The motivation is to have an editor that helps coding in many ways but that is at the same
time simple to work with as much as possible. It is already possible to easily assign files
as a "coding project", to easily switch between a number of set projects at runtime and to
retrieve projects when the program is newly started.
<p>
A list of the features of the program and documentation can be found under
<a href="https://eadgyth.github.io/Programming-Editor/">Help and documentation</a>.
<p>
REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING<br>
Running the program requires Java 8. For compiling Java code by the built-in compile option
installing the JDK 8 is required and it must be ensured that the program is run using the JRE
contained in the JDK. Running it using Java 9 causes some problems with regard to the graphical
interface (as far as seen on Windows 10).
<p>
The program is started by clicking the jar-file 'Eadgyth.jar". This file must be found in the
same folder as the prefs.properties file just like found in the 'EadgythProgram' folder in this
repository.
<p>
LIMITATIONS<br>
Among the countless limitations at the present stage some need mention:
<ul>
<li>Running an interactive program that asks for input through a command-line is not guaranteed
    to work in the console area of the program. Interactive programs in Java seem to work fine but,
    for example, an interactive Perl script does not unless the autoflushing of Perl's STDOUT is
    enabled in the script itself.</li>
<li>The compilation of java files and the creation of an executable jar file cannot include
    exteral libraries if the corresponding pre-defined options in the menu or the toolbar are
    selected.</li>
<li>The printing to a printer is rudimentary and is rather the blueprint for a printing function.
    The font size relative to the page size is not controlled.</li>
<li>The program is so far tested on Windows by the author (me). I would appriciate feedback from
    somebody who may have tried it on other platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>
IDEAS FOR FURTHER DEVELOPEMENT<br>
<ul>
<li>To develop different types of projects (for coding or other). A type of project is defined by
   the interface 'ProjectActions' in the 'projects' package.</li>
<li>To develop "Edit Tools" that can do specialized work with text files. An edit tool implements
   'AddableEditTool' in the 'edittools' package. It's graphical view can be included in the main 
   window and it has access to the file in the selected tab (the interface replaces the plugin
   interface in previous commits).</li>
</ul>
