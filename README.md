This is a text editor, written in Java, which may be used for writing and testing source
code. A goal is that it should be easy to set up a programming project to use built-in
actions to run (or compile/build) an application for testing. Project categories so far
are Java, Perl, Python, R and HTML. Also, a "generic" project may be defined to run
self-chosen system commands. The program includes a basic console, a file explorer and a
basic syntax highlighting.

DOCUMENTATION<br>
A more detailed description of the features, screenshots, a help site and code documentation
can be found under <a href="https://eadgyth.github.io/Programming-Editor/">here</a>.

REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING<br>
Running (and compiling) the program requires Java 8 or higher.
<p>
If the program shall be used for compiling Java code by the built-in compile option it must be
made sure that the program is run using the JRE contained in the JDK (and not the public JRE).
<p>
An executable jar of the program together with a Prefs file is found in the folder
"JarAndPreferences". The jar was created after compiling with Java JDK 8.
<p>
LIMITATIONS<br>
Among the countless limitations some need mention:
<ul>
<li>The editor includes a basic console to show output/error messages from a tested program
    or also freely defined system commands. This console is in principle interactive but
    interaction may not work in all cases. Specifically, the output of processes that buffer
    the standard output is not shown interactively but only after the process ended. Therefore,
    buffering would have to be disabled, for example, by specifying a corresponding command
    option, if available for a given language/process.</li>
<li>The compilation of java files and the creation of an executable jar file cannot include
    external libraries if the built-in options for compiling and crating a jar are selected.</li>
<li>I tested the program on Windows. There are some problems with the graphical appearance
    on a high dpi screen. I would be grateful for feedback, especially from somebody who may
    have tried it on other platforms (m.bussiek@web.de).</li>
