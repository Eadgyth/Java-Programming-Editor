This is a simple text editor, written in Java, with features that can help in smaller coding
projects, maybe for learning and home requirements. Project categories in the present version
are Java (so far worked out most), Perl, R and HTML. However, the code is made to implement
other project categories.
<p>
Files in a directory can be quite easily assigned as a project for creating and testing source
code. A number of projects can be defined during runtime and switched between. Pre-defined actions,
like running a project for testing, are built in and are defined based on the project category.
Also, a generic project that does not depend on any specific file type may be set to run system
commands, for example to execute batch files in a project directory.

DOCUMENTATION<br>
A list of the features of the program, screenshots, a help site and code documentation can be
found under <a href="https://eadgyth.github.io/Programming-Editor/">Eadgyth Programming-Editor</a>.
<p>
REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING<br>
An executable jar of the progam is found in the folder "JarAndPreferences". The jar should be kept
in the same directory as the Preferences file.
<p>
Running (and compiling) the program requires Java 8. Running it using Java 9 causes some problems
with regard to the graphical interface (at least under Windows).
<p>
If the program shall be used for compiling Java code by the built-in compile option it must be made 
that the program is run using the JRE contained in the JDK.
<p>
LIMITATIONS<br>
Among the countless limitations at the present stage some need mention:
<ul>
<li>Running an interactive program that asks for input through a command-line is not guaranteed
    to work in the console area of the program. Interactive programs in Java seem to work fine but,
    for example, an interactive Perl script does not unless the autoflushing of Perl's STDOUT is
    enabled in the script itself.</li>
<li>The compilation of java files and the creation of an executable jar file cannot include
    exteral libraries if the corresponding pre-defined options in the menu or the toolbar are
    selected.</li>
<li>The printing to a printer is rudimentary and is rather the blueprint for a printing function.
    The font size relative to the page size is not controlled.</li>
<li>I tested the program on Windows. I would appriciate feedback, especially from somebody who may
    have tried it on other platforms (m.bussiek@web.de).</li>
</ul>
<p>
IDEAS FOR FURTHER DEVELOPEMENT<br>
<ul>
<li>To implement other project categories. In principle, this is not limited to programming
    and coding projects. A type of project is defined by the interface 'ProjectActions' in the
    'projects' package where the 'run' function could be anything.</li>
<li>To develop "Edit Tools" that can do specialized work with text files. An edit tool implements
    'AddableEditTool' in the 'edittools' package. It's graphical view can be included in the main 
    window and it has access to the file in the selected tab (the interface replaces the plugin
    interface in previous commits).</li>
</ul>
