# Java-Programming-Editor / Eadgyth
A text editor written in Java that helps programming (currently in Java) and that is extensible by plugins which may be developed to work with text files in many ways. It is mainly indented for writing smaller applications, may be
for home-requirements.<br>
<p>
Eadgyth features opening files in tabs, a file tree view, a simple console, syntax coloring,
auto indentation (still simple) and line numbering. Java code can be compiled and run within
the program and a jar file can be created (containing only .class files, though).
<p>
REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING <br>
Running the program requires JAVA 8 (JRE 8) and, for compiling java source files,
installing the JDK (I have used the JDK by Oracle). I did not have the opportunity to test
the program on operating systems other than windows Vista, 7 and 10.<p>
The program must be found in the same folder as the two .properties files and the Resources
folder, just like in the 'EadgythProgram' folder in this repository.<p>
Plugins must be stored in the folder 'Plugins' in the same folder as the program. <p>
To compile the program the source files (packages) must be placed in a directory that also
includes the ".properties" files and the 'Resources' folder.<p>
A guide how to configure a project and how to use the console is provided in the Resources
folder (Help.html) and is adressable from the '?' menu. 
<p>
DOCUMENTATION <br>
The javadoc of the program is found in this repository (Ead-JavaDoc).
<p>
IDEA FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND USAGE <br>
The program includes an interface that defines an object type that can be used by the
Editor to configure and run a programming project. This interface is called
'ProjectActions' in the package 'eg.projects'. An object
of type 'ProjectActions' is created by the class 'ProjectFactory' which would
have to be modified to add <i>"Actions"</i> classes that implement the interface.
Currently, the program includes the JavaActions class. As an example for using the interface
to integrate another language, the 'HtmlActions' class is added (which simply executes html
code writen in the editor in a browser, though). Therefore, the program may be adapted to
special needs or be genarally extended.<br>
<p>
The pogram includes the possiblity to add plugins as jar files. A plugin must implement
the interface 'Pluggable' found in 'eg.plugin' package. Such plugin has access to the text document
in the currently selected tab and can have a graphical view that is integrated in the main window.
A template for writing a plugin and two simple example plugins are included<br>
<p>
ENCOUNTERED PROBLEMS/LIMITATIONS <br>
1) Quickly repeating undo/redo actions have caused the program to hang.
<br>
2) I try to make the syntax coloring, which uses the StyledDocument, effective by letting
the updates be done only in the current line (except for block comments). Problems have occured
when larger chunks of text are pasted in the text area or are deleted /replaced.
<br>
3) The console has a function to run system commands (defined the class 'ProcessStarter' in the
package 'eg.console'). Interactive programs that then require reading from and writing to the
started process by typing in the console are not guaranteed to work. Interactive programs
in Java seem to work fine.
<br>
4) The built in packing of a jar file bundles only .class files.
<br>
5) I have observed that the rendering of the GUI has gone wrong after the computer was in
sleep mode when the system look and feel was selected.
