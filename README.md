# Java-Programming-Editor / Eadgyth
A text editor written in Java that helps coding in Java (Perl, HTML included but less elaborated) and that features a simple but flexible setting of projects.
<p>
The program is extensible by plugins which have access to the editor field in a selected tab and by 
implementing other types of projects using the interface intended for this purpose.
<p>
REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING <br>
Running the program requires JAVA 8 (JRE 8). I did not have the opportunity to test
the program on operating systems other than windows Vista, 7 and 10.<p>
The program must be found in the same folder as the two .properties files and the Resources
folder, just like in the 'EadgythProgram' folder in this repository.<p>
Plugins must be stored in the folder 'Plugins' which must be found in the same folder as the
program. Plugins currently must be available as single jar files.<p>
To compile the program the source files (packages) must be placed in a directory that also
includes the ".properties" files and the 'Resources' folder.<p>
A guide how to configure a project and some other info is found in the Resources
folder (Help.html) and is adressable from the '?' menu. 
<p>
LIMITATIONS <br> 
1) Running an interactive (console) program that then requires writing to this process is not
guaranteed to work in the console panel of the program. Interactive programs in Java seem to
work fine but, for example, an interactive Perl script does not unless the autoflushing of its
STDOUT is enabled in the script itself.
<br>
2) The built in packing of a jar file bundles only .class files.
<br>
3) The printing to a printer is rudimentary and the font size is different from
the corresponding font size in other programs (e.g. Editor in Windows). 
<br>
<p>
PROBLEMS <br>
1) The undo/redo may may cause problems with regard to the syntax coloring. These problems
(which caused the text view to break when a linebreak right before a colored character is undone)
seem to be circumvented (not solved) but it's not certain if that's true all situations.<br>
2) Unexpected rendering of the UI happened when the system look and feel was selected
and the program was idling for a longer period of time (under Windows 10).<br>
<p>
IDEA FOR FURTHER DEVELOPEMENT<br>
1) To develop types of projects (for coding or other). A type of project is defined
by the interface 'ProjectActions' in the 'projects' package.<br>
2) To develop plugins that can do specialized work with text files. Presently, a
plugin would implement the interface 'Pluggable' in the 'plugins' package. An implementing
plugin receives a reference to EditorAccess class which provides a reference to the text
area object (JTextPane) in the currently selected tab, methods to modify text and a method
to add a graphical view in the main window.
