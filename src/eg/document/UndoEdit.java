/**
 * The undo and redo editing.
 * <p>
 * An undoable change to the text (edit) is characterized by its text
 * content, type (insertion or removal) and position.
 * <p>
 * The sequence of edits is divided into larger undoable units by means
 * of breakpoints. A breakpoint may be added when a new edit is added
 * and its value then is the index of the edit that was added previously.
 * An undo action undoes the edits behind a breakpoint (or all if there
 * is none) in reverse order. Accordingly, a redo action redoes the edits
 * in front of a breakpoint (or all if there is none) in forward direction.
 * The starting point of an action is always the edit were undoing or
 * redoing has stopped before.
 * <p>
 * When a new edit is added also a breakpoint is added if
 * <ul>
 * <li> The content of the previous edit is just a newline character.
 * <li> The type of the new edit differs from the type of the
 *      previous edit. However, no breakpoint is added if an insertion
 *      follows a removal that was not triggerd by pressing the delete
 *      or backspace keys, since then a replace action is assumed.
 * <li> The content is longer than one character.
 * <li> A mark was set by {@link #markBreakpoint()}.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * An undoable unit may as well be formed by disabling breakpoint adding.
 * For this {@link #disableBreakpointAdding(boolean)} is invoked before
 * and after adding the edits to be inluded in the undoable unit.
 * <p>
 * Any undone edits are always removed when a new edit is added.
 * <p>
 * Created in {@link TypingEdit}.
