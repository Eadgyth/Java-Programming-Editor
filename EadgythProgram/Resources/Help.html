         <!--Requirements-->
         <h3 id="Requirements">Requirements</h3>
         <p>For a programming project the computer is set up in the same way as if any
            text editor is used for coding and the tested program would be run from a command
            interpreter. Presently, programming projects can be defined for Java and Perl.</p>

         <hr>

         <!--Run project-->
         <h3 id="RunProject">Running a project</h3>

         <h4 id="ProjectTypes">Types of projects</h4>
         <p>Projects of the following types can be assigned to the program:
         </p>
         <ol>
            <li>Java : <a href="#JavaProject">Testing Java code</a></li>
            <li>Perl : <a href="#PerlProject">Testing a Perl script</a></li>
            <li>HTML : <a href="#HtmlProject">Viewing HTML code in the default browser</a></li>
         </ol>

         <h4 id="Config">Configuring a project</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Open a file from or save a new file to the directory that is the supposed
                project root directory. The file may also be located in a sub-directory
                of the root.</li>
            <li>Open the settings window by selecting 'Project' > 'Assign project'.</li>
            <li>Enter the name of the main source file. The main file does not have to be the
                opened file but must exist. For Html only the name of the supposed root
                directory of the project is asked for.</li>
            <li>If the main file is part of a package (applies to Java) enter the package name
                (or the package path) in the field 'Package containing the main class'.</li>
            <li>If source files (or the packages for Java) are saved in a sub-directory of
                the supposed project's root directory the name of this directory is entered in
                the field 'Name of sources directory'.</li>
            <li>The name of a separate destination directory for compiled files (applied to
                Java) maybe entered in the field 'Name of executables directory'. This folder
                will be created in the project's root directory when source files are compiled.</li>
            <li>Click ok. If entries are correct the project can be viewed in the 'Project
                explorer'. This is opened by selecting 'View' > 'Project explorer'.</li>
            <li>The field 'Name of project root' does not have to be filled unless the project
                category is Html.</li>
         </ol>

         <h4 id="ChangeProjects">Changing between projects</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>'Project' > 'Assign project' is selected to assign an additional project. The file
                that is supposed to be part of the new project must be in the selected tab.</li>
            <li>Changing between already set projects is done by selecting a file that is part of
                the project to be set active and then selecting 'Project' > 'Change project' or,
                to additionally view or modify the settings, 'Project' > 'Project settings'.</li>
         </ul>

         <h4 id="Retrieve">Retrieving projects</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>The project that was active when the program was closed the last time is retrieved
                and set active when a file of that project is opened (or a new file is saved to
                that project) and no other project is already active.
            </li>
            <li>If 'Save configuration in the project root' is selected in the settings window the
                parameters for the project are stored in a properties file that is saved in the
                project's root folder. It can be deleted at any time by unselecting the option to save
                it.<br>
                This properties file in way marks a project as an "Eadgyth project". If a file of a
                marked project is opened (or a new file is saved to that project) the project is set
                active even if it was not active lastly. Also, if another project is already active, a
                marked project is loaded and can be set active by selecting 'Project' > 'Change project'.
             </li>
                </ol>
         </ul>

         <h4 id="Language">Setting the language</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>The language is defined based on the extension of an opened or newly saved file.</li>
            <li>Selecting the language in the Edit menu ('Edit' > 'Language') sets the default
                for new empty files.</li>
         </ul>

         <h4 id="JavaProject">Testing Java code and packing a jar file</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Compile the source file(s) by selecting either 'Save selected source file and compile'
                or 'Save all source files and compile' in the 'Project' menu. If errors occured it is
                asked to open the console panel to view messages.
            </li>
            <li>If the compilation was successful the Java program can be run for testing by selecting 
                'Run' in the 'Project' menu. The output and error messages from the tested program are
                displayed in the console panel. If the program asks for input in a command line the input
                is entered in the text area of the console panel. Thee tested program can be forcibly quit
                by clicking the 'stop' symbol in the toolbar of the console panel.
            </li>
            <li>Arguments for a start script may be entered in the text field 'Arguments' (separated by
                single spaces) in the settings window ('Project' > ' Project settings').
            </li>
            <li>A jar file may be created by selecting 'Project' > 'Create
                jar'. The jar file is saved in the executable's folder or, if no such folder is defined,
                in the project's root folder. A name for the jar file can be specified in the settings
                window. If no name is specified the jar name is the same as the name of the main class.
                Note that presently only class files can be bundled in a jar.
             </li>
         </ol>

         <h4 id="PerlProject">Testing a Perl script</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Save changes to the script and select 'Run' in the 'Project' menu.
            </li>
            <li>Any output (error) is shown in the console panel. NOTE: there is a limitation when the
                script asks for input through a command line. In that case any output from the script
                expected before the user input is asked for (like "Enter your name:") is not printed
                (more precisely it's printed only after all inputs were made). The output would be
                shown as expected (as far as tested) if the autoflushing of Perl's STDOUT is turned on
                in the script itself. The other possibilty is, of course, to start the command
                line/terminal of the OS to test the script (see <a href="#Console">Using the console</a>).
            </li>
            <li>Arguments for a start script may be entered in the text field 'Arguments'
                (separated by single spaces) in the settings window ('Project' > 'Project settings').
            </li>
         </ol>

         <h4 id="HtmlProject">Viewing HTML code in a web browser</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Save changes to the selected html file and select 'Run' in the 'Project' menu to view the
                html file in the default web browser.
            </li>
         </ol>

         <!--Console-->
         <h3 id="Console">Using the console</h3>
         <p>The console area shall show messages after compilation of a project and the output of a
            program that is tested.</p>
         <p>In addition, self-chosen system commands entered in a dialog can be run in the current
            working directory (the project's root directory).</p>
         <p>A run process can be forcibly quit by clicking the 'stop' symbol.</p>
         <p>The console does not emulate the terminal of the operating system! However,
            it is possible (or rather not prohibited) to run the system's terminal in the console
            by running the command that starts the terminal (e.g., cmd.exe in Windows). It is
            important to note that a tested program thereupon started from this terminal CANNOT be
            forcibly quit by clicking the 'stop' symbol.</p>
         <p>Hint: using the command to start "THE" terminal (in Windows this would be cmd.exe /c start)
            presets the working directory for the terminal to the project's root directory.</p>

         <h4>To run a system command...</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Open the console panel in the menu 'View' > 'Console'.
            </li>
            <li>Press the button 'Cmd...' and enter a command in the shown dialog window. Klick ok in
                the dialog window to run the command.
            </li>
            <li>To run a previous command press the '>' button; to change a command open the command
                dialog again by clicking 'Cmd...'.
            </li>
         </ol>

         <hr>

         <!--File explorer-->
         <h3 id="Explorer">Using the project explorer</h3>
         <p>The project explorer is opened by selecting 'View' > 'Project explorer'. It shows the file
            system of a project once one is assigned.<br>
            The explorer always shows the project that is currently set active. A few operations are
            supported:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>The project's file system is shown as a tree in which folders are expanded or shrunk by
                clicking the (+), (-) handles, as usual. However, a double left click on a folder symbol
                does not expand/shrink the folder but displays a new tree rooted at the clicked folder.
                To move back the 'Folder up' symbol is clicked. The topmost level is always the project's
                root directory.
            </li>
            <li>A double left click on a file opens the clicked file in a new tab.
            </li>
            <li>A file may be deleted after a right click on a file symbol and selecting'delete'. If the
                deleted file is in an open tab, the tab is not closed but goes into "Save as" mode.
            </li>
            <li>A folder may be as well deleted after a right click on a folder symbol but a folder is
                protected from deletion if it is not empty. The exception is, if present, the folder for
                executable files or its subfolders. This may be deleted for a completely renewed
                compilation.
            </li>
            <li>A new folder may be created after a right click on a folder symbol and selecting
               'Create new folder'.
            </li>
            <li>Changes to the project's file structure made from within the program should be updated
                in the file view (???). Changes made from outside the program would be updated
                "manually" by clicking the 'refresh' symbol.
            </li>
