         <!--Requirements--> 
         <li><h3 id="Requirements">Requirements</h3>
         <p>The Java runtime environment must be version JRE 8 to run Eadgyth.</p>
         <p>For a programming project in Java it is required that a Java development
            kit (JDK) is installed and the computer is set up to use the JDK. For the JDK
            of Oracle, see:      
            <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html">
            Oracle JDK</a>. Also, the filepath of the JDK must be saved in the
            &lsquo;settings.properties&rsquo; file in the program folder. If this is not
            done in the file itself, the program asks to enter the filepath in a dialog
            the first time it is tried to compile source files or if a new version
            of the JDK was installed.</p>
   
         <!--Run project-->
         <li><h3 id="RunProject">Running a Java project</h3>
         <h4 id="ProjectSettings">Project settings</h4>
         <p>The setting of a project always starts from an existing file that is opened
            (or newly saved) and is in the selected tab. The file is found in a directory
            that is supposed to be the project's root or in sub-directories of this root,
            i.e. a separate directory for sources and/or a package.</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Open a java source file or save an unnamed tab as a java source file.</li>
            <li>Open the settings window using &lsquo;Project settings&rsquo; in the menu
                &lsquo;Project&rsquo;.</li>
            <li>Enter the name of the source file that contains the main method in the text
                field &lsquo;Name of main program file&rsquo; (without extension). The main
                file does not have to be the opened file.</li>
            <li>If the main file is part of a package enter the package name in the text field
                &lsquo;Package with main class&rsquo;. If it is located in a sub-package
                enter the path with normal file separators (slash in Windows).</li>
            <li>If the directory that contains source files (or packages) is not supposed
                to be the project's root but a separate sources directory the name of this
                directory is entered in text field &lsquo;Sources directory&rsquo;.</li>
            <li>A separate destination directory for compiled class files maybe entered in the
                text field &lsquo;Executables directory&rsquo; (the folder will be created
                during compilation).</li>
            <li>Click ok. If entries are correct the project can be viewed in the &lsquo;Project
                explorer&rsquo; that is opened in the &lsquo;View&rsquo; menu.</li>
         </ol>
   
         <h4 id="Compiling">Compiling and testing a project</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Compile the source file(s) using &lsquo;Save all and compile&rsquo; in the
                &lsquo;Project&rsquo; menu. If errors occur you will be asked to open the
                console to view messages.</li>
            <li>If the compilation was successful the new program can be run for testing by
                using &lsquo;Run&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Project&rsquo; menu (this will also open the
                console panel). The tested program can be forcibly quit by clicking the
                &lsquo;stop&rsquo; symbol in the toolbar of the console panel.</li>
            <li>Arguments for a start script may be entered in the text field &lsquo;Arguments&rsquo;
                (separated by single spaces) in the Settings window</li>
            <li>A jar file may be created by selecting &lsquo;Project&rsquo; > &lsquo;Create jar&rsquo;
                The jar file is saved in the executable's folder or, if no such folder is
                defined, in the project's root folder.
                </li>
         </ol>
   
         <h4 id="OtherProjects">Other projects than Java?</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>A project directory maybe set for the txt file type. This would be done just
                to view files in the project explorer but there are no actions associated with
                such project.</li>
            <li>A project maybe also set for the html file type. HTML code can then be viewed
                in the default browser by selecting &lsquo;Project&rsquo; > &lsquo;Run&rsquo;.
                The name of the file that is viewed is entered in the text field
                &lsquo;HTML file&rsquo; in the settings window. The keyword coloring for html
                code is rudimentary though.</li>
         </ul>
         
         <h4 id="ChangeProjects">Changing between projects</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>Different projects may set during a session. A new project is set by opening a file
                that is not part of the currently active project and then opening the settings window
                (&lsquo;Project&rsquo; > &lsquo;Project settings&rsquo;). to define the project's
                directories. The file must be found in the selected tab.
            <li>Changing between already set projects is done by selecting a file that is part of
                the project to be set active and using &lsquo;Project&rsquo; > &lsquo;Change
                project&rsquo;.
            <li>The option &lsquo;Save settings in project folder&rsquo; in the settings window
                is checked to save the specified directories in an extra &lsquo;config&rsquo;
                file. This file turns the folder into &lsquo;<i>a project</i>&rsquo; which can be
                changed to directly by selecting &lsquo;Change project&rsquo; if a file of this
                project is in the selected tab. The project would also be set active directly
                if no other project is active already. Unchecking removes the &lsquo;config&rsquo;
                file.</li>
         </ul>
   
         <!--Console-->
         <li><h3 id="Console">Using the console</h3>
         <p>The console area shall show messages after compilation of a project and the output of
            a program that is tested. Interactive programs can be run too, at least Java programs.</p>
         <p>In addition, self-chosen system commands entered in a dialog can be run in the current
            working directory (a project's root directory). A run process can be forcibly quit by
            clicking the &lsquo;stop&rsquo; symbol.</p>
         <p>Note that the console does not work as the terminal of the operating system. However,
            it is possible (or rather not prohibited) to run the system's terminal in the console by
            running the command that starts the terminal (e.g., cmd.exe in Windows). It is important
            to note that a tested program thereupon started from this terminal CANNOT be forcibly
            quit by clicking the &lsquo;stop&rsquo; symbol.</p>
   
         <h4>To run a system command...</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Open the console panel in the menu &lsquo;View&rsquo;.</li>
            <li>Press the button &lsquo;Cmd...&rsquo; and enter a command in the shown dialog window.
                 Click ok in the dialog window to run the command.</li>
            <li>To run a previous command press the &lsquo;>&rsquo; button; to change a command open
                the command dialog again by clicking &lsquo;Cmd...&rsquo;.</li>
         </ol>
   
         <h4>Further options</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>A new instance of Eadgyth can be run from the console by pressing the button with
                the Eadgyth icon. One reason to do this would be to view the output when a new plugin
                is tested.</li>
         </ul>
   
         <!--File explorer-->
         <li><h3 id="Explorer">Using the project explorer</h3>
         <p>The project explorer can be opened by selecting
            &lsquo;View&rsquo; > &lsquo;Project explorer&rsquo; once a project is defined.<br>
            The explorer always shows the project that is currently set active. A few operations
            are supported:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>The project's file system is shown as a tree in which folders are expanded or
                shrunk by clicking the (+), (-) handles, as usual. However, a double left
                click on a folder symbol does not expand/shrink the folder but displays a new
                tree rooted at the clicked folder. To move back the &lsquo;Folder up&rsquo; symbol
                is clicked. The topmost level is always the project's root directory.</li>
            <li>A double left click on a file opens the clicked file in a new tab.</li>
            <li>A file may be deleted after a right click on a file symbol and selecting
                &lsquo;delete&rsquo;. If the deleted file is in an open tab, the tab is
                is not closed but goes into &lsquo;Save as&rsquo; mode.</li>
            <li>A folder may be as well deleted after a right click on a folder symbol but
                a folder is protected from deletion if it is not empty. The exception is, if
                present, the separate folder for executable files or its subfolders. This may
                be deleted for a completely renewed compilation</li>
            <li>A new folder may be created after a right click on a folder symbol and selecting
                &lsquo;Create new folder&rsquo;.</li>
            <li>Changes to the project's file structure made from within the program should be
                updated in the file view (no guarantee). Changes made from outside the program
                would be updated &lsquo;manually&rsquo; by clicking the &lsquo;refresh&rsquo;
                symbol.</li>
          </ul></li>
       </ul>
