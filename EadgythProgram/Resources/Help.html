      <h2>Eadgyth help (still in progress)</h2>
      <h4>Requirements</h4>
      <p>It is required that a Java
         development kit (JDK) is installed and the computer is set up to use
         the JDK. For the JDK of Oracle, see:<br>      
      <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html">
      Oracle JDK</a></p>
      <p>The Java runtime environment must be version JRE 8 to run Eadgyth.</P>
      <h4>Configuring a java project</h4>
      <p> The setting of a project starts with an existing file. This is to say that
          also the project's working directory, subdirectory (e.g. for source files,
          package) must be created before a project can be configured. On the other
          hand no extra configuration file is created so that a project can be defined
          for any existing directory that contains source files.
      <ol>
         <li>Open a java source file or save an unnamed tab as a java source file.
             Only at the first time you will be asked to enter the filepath of
             the JDK.</li>
         <li>Open the settings window using &lsquo;Set up project&rsquo; in the menu
             &lsquo;Project&rsquo;.</li>
         <li>Enter the name of the source file that contains the main method in the text
             field &lsquo;Name of main program file&rsquo; (without extension).</li>
         <li>If this file is part of a package enter the package name in the text field
             &lsquo;Package&rsquo;. If it is located in a sub-package(s) enter the package
             path with normal file separators (slash in Windows).</li>
         <li>If source files (or packages) are located in a separate directory, the name of
             this directory (e.g., &lsquo;scr&rsquo;) is entered in the text field &lsquo;Sources
             directory&rsquo;.</li>
         <li>A separate destination directory for compiled source files (e.g., &lsquo;bin&rsquo;)
             maybe entered in the text field &lsquo;Executables directory&rsquo; (the folder will
             be created during compilation).</li>
         <li>Click ok. If entries are correct the project can be viewed in the &lsquo;Project
             explorer&rsquo; that is opened in the menu &lsquo;View&rsquo;</li>
         <li>Compile the source file(s) using &lsquo;Save all and compile&rsquo; in the
             &lsquo;Project&rsquo; menu. If errors occur you will be asked to open the console to
             view messages.</li>
         <li>Run the project using &lsquo;Run&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Project&rsquo; menu (this will
             open the console panel).</li>
         <li>A jar file may be created by using &lsquo;Build&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Project&rsquo; menu.<p>
      </ol>
      <h5>Further options</h5>
      <ul>
         <li>Arguments for a start script may be entered in the text field &lsquo;Arguments&rsquo;
             (separated by single spaces).</li>
         <li>The name of a build file (jar file in the case of java) can be specified in the field
             &lsquo;Name for jar file&rsquo;. If the field is not filled, the jar name is the name of the
             java file that contains the main method.</li>
         <li>The project can be changed by opening a file that does not belong to the current project.
             Then proceed as in steps 2 to 7 if the projects was not previouly configures or use
             &lsquo;Switch project&rsquo;.</li>
         <li>An existing project configuration will be retrieved upon opening any file of a project
             previously worked on.</li>
         <li> A project maybe also defined for a txt file (which only allows viewing file in the project
               explorer) or for a HTML file which can be shown in Web browser using &lsquo;Run&rsquo; in
               the &lsquo;Project&rsquo; menu.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Using the console</h4>
      <p>The console area shall show messages after compilation of a project and the output of a program that was
      started as in step 9 (see above). Interactive programs can be run too, but it is not clear yet if this works
      in all situations.</p>
      <p>In addition, self-chosen system commands entered in a dialogue maybe run in the current working directory
      (the root directory of a project). For example, a created jar file may be tested by the command
      java -jar SomeProgram.jar. A run process can be forcibly quit using the &lsquo;stop&rsquo; button. Note that
      &lsquo;system command&rsquo; does not mean that it is possible to run directly terminal commands. While it is
      possible to run the terminal in the console (by using the system command that starts the terminal) a program
      thereupon started from this terminal cannot be forcibly quit using the &lsquo;stop&rsquo; button.</p>
      <h5>To run a command...</h5>
      <ol>
         <li>Open the console panel in the menu &lsquo;View&rsquo;.</li>
         <li>Press the button &lsquo;Cmd&rsquo; and enter a command in the shown dialog window. Click ok in the
         dialog window to run the command.</li>
         <li>To run a previous command press the &lsquo;>&rsquo; button; to change a command open the command
         dialog again by pressing the &lsquo;Cmd...&rsquo; button.
      </ol>
