      <h2>Eadgyth help (still in progress)</h2>
      <h4>Requirements</h4>
      <p>The Java runtime environment must be version JRE 8 to run Eadgyth.</p>
      <p>For a Java project it is required that a Java development kit (JDK)
         is installed and the computer is set up to use the JDK. For the JDK
         of Oracle, see:      
         <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html">
         Oracle JDK</a>. Also, the filepath of the JDK must be saved in the
         &lsquo;settings&rsquo; file. This, if not done already, the program asks
         for the first time it is tried to compile source files.</p>
      <h4>Configuring and testing a Java project</h4>
      <h5>Project settings</h5>
      <p>The setting of a project always starts from an existing file that is opened
         (or newly saved) and is in the selected tab. The file is found in a directory
         that is supposed to be the project's root or in sub-directories of this root,
         i.e. a separate directory for sources and/or a package.</p>    
      <ol>
         <li>Open a java source file or save an unnamed tab as a java source file.</li>
         <li>Open the settings window using &lsquo;Project settings&rsquo; in the menu
             &lsquo;Project&rsquo;.</li>
         <li>Enter the name of the source file that contains the main method in the text
             field &lsquo;Name of main program file&rsquo; (without extension). The main
             file does not have to be the opened file.</li>
         <li>If the main file is part of a package enter the package name in the text field
             &lsquo;Package with main class&rsquo;. If it is located in a sub-package
             enter the path with normal file separators (slash in Windows).</li>
         <li>If the directory that contains source files (or packages) is not supposed
             to be the project's root but a separate sources directory the name of this
             directory is entered in text field &lsquo;Sources directory&rsquo;.</li>
         <li>A separate destination directory for compiled class files maybe entered in the
             text field &lsquo;Executables directory&rsquo; (the folder will be created
             during compilation).</li>
         <li>Click ok. If entries are correct the project can be viewed in the &lsquo;Project
             explorer&rsquo; that is opened in the &lsquo;View&rsquo; menu.</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Compiling and running a project</h5>
      <ol>
         <li>Compile the source file(s) using &lsquo;Save all and compile&rsquo; in the
             &lsquo;Project&rsquo; menu. If errors occur you will be asked to open the
             console to view messages.</li>
         <li>If the compilation was successful the new program can be run for testing by
             using &lsquo;Run&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Project&rsquo; menu (this will also open the
             console panel). The tested program can be forcibly quit using the &lsquo;stop&rsquo;
             button of the console panel.</li>
         <li>Arguments for a start script may be entered in the text field &lsquo;Arguments&rsquo;
             (separated by single spaces) in the Settings window</li>
         <li>A jar file may be created by using &lsquo;Build&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Project&rsquo;
             menu.</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Changing between projects</h5>
      <ul>
         <li>A new project can be set by opening a file that is not part of the current project
             and then opening the settings window (&lsquo;Project&rsquo; > &lsquo;Project
             settings&rsquo;). The new file must be in the selected tab.
         <li>Changing between already set projects is done by selecting a file that is part of
             the project to be set active and using &lsquo;Project&rsquo; > &lsquo;Change
             project&rsquo;.      
         <li>A project maybe also defined for a txt file (which only allows viewing files in the project
             explorer) or for a HTML file which can be shown in Web browser by using &lsquo;Run&rsquo; in
             the &lsquo;Project&rsquo; menu. The keyword coloring for html code is rudimentary though.
         </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Using the console</h4>
      <p>The console area shall show messages after compilation of a project and the output of a
      program that is tested. Interactive programs can be run too, at least Java programs.</p>
      <p>In addition, self-chosen system commands entered in a dialog can be run in the current
      working directory. For example, a created jar file may be tested by the command 
      java -jar SomeProgram.jar. A run process can be forcibly quit using the &lsquo;stop&rsquo;
      button.</p>
      <p> Note that the console is not a terminal so that terminal commands are initially invalid.
      While it is possible to run the terminal in the console (by using the system command that
      starts the terminal) a program thereupon started from this terminal cannot be forcibly quit
      using the &lsquo;stop&rsquo; button.</p>
      <h5>To run a system command...</h5>
      <ol>
         <li>Open the console panel in the menu &lsquo;View&rsquo;.</li>
         <li>Press the button &lsquo;Cmd...&rsquo; and enter a command in the shown dialog window. Click
             ok in the dialog window to run the command.</li>
         <li>To run a previous command press the &lsquo;>&rsquo; button; to change a command open the
             command dialog again by pressing the &lsquo;Cmd...&rsquo; button.
      </ol>
      <h5>Further options</h5>
      <ul>
         <li>A new instance of Eadgyth can be run from the console by pressing the button with Eadgyth icon.
             One reason to do this would be to view the output from a tested new plugin.</li>
      </ul>
