      <!--Requirements--> 
      <h3 id="Requirements">Requirements</h3>
      <p>The Java runtime environment must be version JRE 8 to run Eadgyth.</p>
      <p>For a programming project the computer is simply set up in the same way
         as if any text editor is used for coding. Presently, programming projects
         can be set for Java and Perl.</p>

      <!--Run project-->
      <h3 id="RunProject">Running a project</h3>

      <h4 id="ProjectTypes">Types of projects</h4>
      <p>The following types of projects may be defined:</p> 
      <ol>
         <li><a href="#JavaProject">Java</a> (file extension is .java) 
         <li><a href="#PerlProject">Perl</a> (file extension is .pl, .pm)
         <li><a href="#HtmlProject">HTML</a> (file extension is .html)
      </ol>

      <h4 id="Config">Configuring a project</h4>
      <p>The setting of a project always starts from an existing file that is opened
         (or newly saved) and is in the selected tab. The file is found in a directory
         that is supposed to be the project's root or in sub-directories of this root,
         e.g. a separate directory for source files.</p>
      <ol>
         <li>Open a file or save a new file that is of one of the file types mentioned above.</li>
         <li>Open the settings window by selecting &lsquo;Project&rsquo; > 
             &lsquo;Project settings&rsquo;.</li>     
         <li>Enter the name of the main source file without extension. The main file does
             not have to be the opened file.</li>
         <li>If the main file is part of a package (applies only to Java)
             enter the package name in the text field &lsquo;Package with main class&rsquo;.
             If it is located in a sub-package enter the path with normal file separators
             (slash in Windows).</li>
         <li>If the directory that contains source files (or packages) is not supposed
             to be the project's root but a separate source directory the name of this
             directory is entered in text field &lsquo;Source directory&rsquo;.</li>
         <li>A separate destination directory for compiled files (applies only to Java) maybe
             entered in the text field &lsquo;Executable directory&rsquo; (the folder will be
             created during compilation).</li>
         <li>Click ok. If entries are correct the project can be viewed in the &lsquo;Project
             explorer&rsquo; that is opened in the &lsquo;View&rsquo; menu.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h4 id="ChangeProjects">Changing between projects</h4>
      <ul>
         <li>Different projects may set during a session. A new project is set by opening a file
             that is not part of the currently active project and then opening the settings window
             (&lsquo;Project&rsquo; > &lsquo;Project settings&rsquo;) to define the project's
             directories. The file must be found in the selected tab.</li>
         <li>Changing between already set projects is done by selecting a file that is part of
             the project to be set active and then selecting &lsquo;Project&rsquo; > &lsquo;Change
             project&rsquo; or, to view or modify settings, &lsquo;Project&rsquo; > &lsquo;Project
             settings&rsquo;.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4 id="Retrieve">Retrieving projects</h4>
      <ul>
         <li>When a file is opened that is part of the project that was active when
             the program was quit the last time this project is directly set active
             if no other project is active already. The settings can be viewed in the 
             settings window (&lsquo;Project&rsquo; >  &lsquo;Project settings&rsquo;).</li>
         <li>If &lsquo;Save settings in 'eadconfig' file&rsquo; is selected the configuration
             of the project is stored in the project folder. What does that do? <br>
             1) If a file of a project marked in this way is opened (or one
             is saved to that project) the settings are loaded and the option
             &lsquo;Project&rsquo; > &lsquo;Change project&rsquo; can be used to change
             to that project.<br>
             2) A marked project is directly set active if a file of that project is
             opened and no other project is active already.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="JavaProject">Testing Java code and packing a jar file</h4>
      <ol>
         <li>Compile the source file(s) using &lsquo;Save all and compile&rsquo; in the
             &lsquo;Project&rsquo; menu. If errors occur you will be asked to open the
             console to view messages.</li>
         <li>If the compilation was successful the new program can be run for testing by
             using &lsquo;Run&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Project&rsquo; menu. Any output and error
             messages from the tested program are displayed in the console panel. The tested
             program can be forcibly quit by clicking the &lsquo;stop&rsquo; symbol in the
             toolbar of the console panel.</li>
         <li>Arguments for a start script may be entered in the text field &lsquo;Arguments&rsquo;
             (separated by single spaces) in the Settings window</li>
         <li>A jar file may be created by selecting &lsquo;Project&rsquo; > &lsquo;Create
             jar&rsquo;. The jar file is saved in the executable's folder or, if no such folder
             is defined, in the project's root folder. A name for the jar file can be
             specified in the settings window. If no name is given the jar name is the same
             as that for the main class. Note that presently only class files can be bundled
             in a jar.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h4 id="PerlProject">Testing a Perl script</h4>
      <ol>
         <li>A perl script can be run in the console panel for testing by selecting
             &lsquo;Project&rsquo; > &lsquo;Run&rsquo;. There is a limitation when the script
             asks for input through a command prompt: messages from the perl program are not
             displayed in the expected order. However, it does work as expected when the
             autoflushing of Perl's STDOUT is turned on in the script. The other possibilty is,
             of course, to start an external command prompt to test the script (see <a
             href="#Console">Using the console</a>).
         <li>The syntax coloring for Perl is presently very basic.</li>
      </ol>
         
      <h4 id="HtmlProject">Viewing HTML code in a web browser</h4>
      <ol>
         <li>Save changes to the file and select &lsquo;Run&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Project&rsquo;
             menu to view the html file in the default web browser.</li>
         <li>As for Perl code, the syntax coloring is presently rudimentary.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <hr>
   
      <!--Console-->
      <h3 id="Console">Using the console</h3>
      <p>The console area shall show messages after compilation of a project and the output of
         a program that is tested.</p>
      <p>In addition, self-chosen system commands entered in a dialog can be run in the current
         working directory (the project's root directory). A run process can be forcibly quit by
         clicking the &lsquo;stop&rsquo; symbol.</p>
      <p>The console does not emulate the terminal of the operating system though. However,
         it is possible (or rather not prohibited) to run the system's terminal in the console
         by running the command that starts the terminal (e.g., cmd.exe in Windows). It is
         important to note that a tested program thereupon started from this terminal CANNOT be
         forcibly quit by clicking the &lsquo;stop&rsquo; symbol.</p>
      <p>Hint: using the command to start &lsquo;THE&rsquo; terminal (in Windows this would be
         cmd.exe /c start) presets the working directory for the terminal to the project's root
         directory.

      <h4>To run a system command...</h4>
      <ol>
         <li>Open the console panel in the menu &lsquo;View&rsquo;.</li>
         <li>Press the button &lsquo;Cmd...&rsquo; and enter a command in the shown dialog window.
              Click ok in the dialog window to run the command.</li>
         <li>To run a previous command press the &lsquo;>&rsquo; button; to change a command open
             the command dialog again by clicking &lsquo;Cmd...&rsquo;.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Further options</h4>
      <ul>
         <li>A new instance of Eadgyth can be run from the console by pressing the button with
             the Eadgyth icon. One reason to do this would be to view the output when a new plugin
             is tested.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <hr>
   
      <!--File explorer-->
      <h3 id="Explorer">Using the project explorer</h3>
      <p>The project explorer can be opened by selecting
         &lsquo;View&rsquo; > &lsquo;Project explorer&rsquo; once a project is defined.<br>
         The explorer always shows the project that is currently set active. A few operations
         are supported:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>The project's file system is shown as a tree in which folders are expanded or
             shrunk by clicking the (+), (-) handles, as usual. However, a double left
             click on a folder symbol does not expand/shrink the folder but displays a new
             tree rooted at the clicked folder. To move back the &lsquo;Folder up&rsquo; symbol
             is clicked. The topmost level is always the project's root directory.</li>
         <li>A double left click on a file opens the clicked file in a new tab.</li>
         <li>A file may be deleted after a right click on a file symbol and selecting
             &lsquo;delete&rsquo;. If the deleted file is in an open tab, the tab is
             is not closed but goes into &lsquo;Save as&rsquo; mode.</li>
         <li>A folder may be as well deleted after a right click on a folder symbol but
             a folder is protected from deletion if it is not empty. The exception is, if
             present, the separate folder for executable files or its subfolders. This may
             be deleted for a completely renewed compilation</li>
         <li>A new folder may be created after a right click on a folder symbol and selecting
             &lsquo;Create new folder&rsquo;.</li>
         <li>Changes to the project's file structure made from within the program should be
             updated in the file view (no guarantee). Changes made from outside the program
             would be updated &lsquo;manually&rsquo; by clicking the &lsquo;refresh&rsquo;
             symbol.</li>
