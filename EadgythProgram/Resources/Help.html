         <!--Requirements-->
         <h3 id="Requirements">Requirements</h3>
         <p>For programming project the computer is set up in the same way as if any
            text editor is href used for coding and the tested program would be run from a command
            interpreter. Presently, programming projects can be defined for Java and Perl.</p>

         <hr>

         <!--Run project-->
         <h3 id="RunProject">Running a project</h3>

         <h4 id="ProjectTypes">Types of projects</h4>
         <p>The following types of projects may be defined and would be recognized based
            on the file extension:</p>
         <ol>
            <li><a href="#JavaProject">Java</a> (file extension is .java)
            <li><a href="#PerlProject">Perl</a> (file extensions are .pl, .pm)
            <li><a href="#HtmlProject">HTML</a> (file extensions are .html, .htm, .js)
         </ol>

         <h4 id="Config">Configuring a project</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Open a file or save a new file that is part of a project to be defined.</li>
            <li>Open the settings window by selecting 'Project' > 'Assign project' (or
                'Project settings' at this point, see
                <a href="#ChangeProjects">Changing between projects</a>).</li>
            <li>Enter the name of the main source file without extension. The main file does
                not have to be the opened file but must exist.</li>
            <li>If the main file is part of a package (for Java) enter the package name (or
                the package path) in the text field 'Package containing the main class'.</li>
            <li>If the directory that contains source files (or packages) is not supposed
                to be the project's root (i.e. the working directory) but a sub-directory for
                sources the name of this directory is entered in text field 'Name of sources
                directory'.</li>
            <li>A separate destination directory for compiled files (for Java) maybe entered
                in the text field 'Name of executables directory'. This folder will be created
                during compilation in the root directoy.</li>
            <li>Click ok. If entries are correct, the project can be viewed in the 'Project
                explorer' that is opened by selecting 'View' > 'Project explorer'.</li>
            <li>The field 'Name of project root' does not have to be filled. However, entering
                a name enforces that the determined root directory has this name. The text
                field anyway shows the name of the root when the settings window is newly opened
                or if a previous project is <a href="#Retrieve">retrieved</a>. It must be cleared
                (or modified) if an existing project root is to be changed.</li>
         </ol>

         <h4 id="ChangeProjects">Changing between projects</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>'Project' > 'Assign project' is selected to assign an additional project. The file
                that is supposed to be part of the new project must be in the selected tab.</li>
            <li>Changing between already set projects is done by selecting a file that is part of
                the project to be set active and then selecting 'Project' > 'Change project' or,
                to additionally view or modify the settings, 'Project' > 'Project settings'.</li>
         </ul>

         <h4 id="Retrieve">Retrieving projects</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>The project that was active when the program was closed the last time is retrieved
                and set active when a file of that project is opened (or a new file is saved to
                that project) and no other project is already active.</li>
            <li>If 'Save eadconfig file' is selected in the settings window the configuration of the
                project is stored in such config file. This is saved in the project folder but can
                be deleted at any time by unselecting the option to save it. A project is, in a way,
                "marked" as one by the presence of the eadconfig file which means two things:<br>
                <ol>
                   <li>If a file of a marked project is opened (or one is saved to that project) the
                       settings are loaded even if another project is active. Selecting 'Project' >
                       'Change project' can be used to change to that project. 'Project' > 'Project
                       settings' is selected to additionally view or alter the retrieved settings.</li>
                   <li>A marked project is directly set active if a file of that project is opened and
                       no other project is active even though that project was not necessarily active
                       lastly when the program was closed.</li>
                </ol>
         </ul>

         <h4 id="Language">Setting the language</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>The language defines the syntax coloring and auto-indentation and is set based on
                the extension of the selected file.</li>
            <li>If a selected tab is unnamed the language can be selected in the Edit menu ('Edit' >
                'Languages').</li>
         </ul>

         <h4 id="JavaProject">Testing Java code and packing a jar file</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Compile the source file(s) by selecting either 'Save selected source file and
                compile' or 'Save all opened source files and compile' in the 'Project' menu.
                If errors occured it is asked to open the console panel to view messages.</li>
            <li>If the compilation was successful the new program can be run for testing by
                using 'Run' in the 'Project' menu. The output and error messages from the tested 
                program are displayed in the console panel. The tested program can be forcibly
                quit by clicking the 'stop' symbol in the toolbar of the console panel.</li>
            <li>Arguments for a start script may be entered in the text field 'Arguments'
                (separated by single spaces) in the settings window ('Project' > '
                Project settings').</li>
            <li>A jar file may be created by selecting 'Project' > 'Create
                jar'. The jar file is saved in the executable's folder or, if no such folder
                is defined, in the project's root folder. A name for the jar file can be specified
                in the settings window. If no name is specified the jar name is the same as the
                name of the main class. Note that presently only class files can be bundled in a
                jar.</li>
         </ol>

         <h4 id="PerlProject">Testing a Perl script</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Save changes to the script and select 'Run' in the 'Project' menu.</li>
            <li>Any output (error) is shown in the console panel. NOTE: there is a limitation when the
                script asks for input through a command line. In that case any output from the script
                expected before the user input is asked for (like "Enter your name:") is not printed
                (more precisely it's printed only after all inputs were made). The output would be shown
                as expected (as far as tested) if the autoflushing of Perl's STDOUT is turned on in the
                script itself. The other possibilty is, of course, to start the command line/terminal
                of the OS to test the script (see <a href="#Console">Using the console</a>).</li>
            <li>Arguments for a start script may be entered in the text field 'Arguments'
                (separated by single spaces) in the settings window ('Project' > 'Project settings').</li>
         </ol>

         <h4 id="HtmlProject">Viewing HTML code in a web browser</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Save changes to the file and select 'Run' in the 'Project' menu to view the html file in
                the default web browser.</li>
         </ol>

         <!--Console-->
         <h3 id="Console">Using the console</h3>
         <p>The console area shall show messages after compilation of a project and the output of
            a program that is tested.</p>
         <p>In addition, self-chosen system commands entered in a dialog can be run in the current
            working directory (the project's root directory). A run process can be forcibly quit by
            clicking the 'stop' symbol.</p>
         <p>The console does not emulate the terminal of the operating system! However,
            it is possible (or rather not prohibited) to run the system's terminal in the console
            by running the command that starts the terminal (e.g., cmd.exe in Windows). It is
            important to note that a tested program thereupon started from this terminal CANNOT be
            forcibly quit by clicking the 'stop' symbol.</p>
         <p>
         <p>Hint: using the command to start 'THE' terminal (in Windows this would be
            cmd.exe /c [some command]) presets the working directory for the terminal to the
            project's root directory.

         <h4>To run a system command...</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Open the console panel in the menu 'View'.</li>
            <li>Press the button 'Cmd..' and enter a command in the shown dialog window.
                klick ok in the dialog window to run the command.</li>
            <li>To run a previous command press the '>' button; to change a command open
                the command dialog again by clicking 'Cmd...'.</li>
         </ol>

         <h4>Further options</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>A new instance of Eadgyth can be run from the console by pressing the button with
                the Eadgyth icon in the toolbar of the console panel. One reason to do this would
                be to view the output when a plugin is tested.</li>
         </ul>
         <a href="#ancor">Back to top</a>
         <hr>

         <!--File explorer-->
         <h3 id="Explorer">Using the project explorer</h3>
         <p>The project explorer can be opened by selecting 'View' > 'Project explorer' once a
            project is assigned.<br>
            The explorer always shows the project that is currently set active. A few operations
            are supported:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>The project's file system is shown as a tree in which folders are expanded or
                shrunk by clicking the (+), (-) handles, as usual. However, a double left
                click on a folder symbol does not expand/shrink the folder but displays a new
                tree rooted at the clicked folder. To move back the 'Folder up' symbol
                is clicked. The topmost level is always the project's root directory.</li>
            <li>A double left click on a file opens the clicked file in a new tab.</li>
            <li>A file may be deleted after a right click on a file symbol and selecting
                'delete'. If the deleted file is in an open tab, the tab is not closed but
                 goes into 'Save as' mode.</li>
            <li>A folder may be as well deleted after a right click on a folder symbol but
                a folder is protected from deletion if it is not empty. The exception is, if
                present, the folder for executable files or its subfolders. This may be
                deleted for a completely renewed compilation</li>
            <li>A new folder may be created after a right click on a folder symbol and selecting
               'Create new folder'.</li>
            <li>Changes to the project's file structure made from within the program should be
                updated in the file view (no guarantee). Changes made from outside the program
                would be updated "manually" by clicking the 'refresh' symbol.</li>
          </ul>
