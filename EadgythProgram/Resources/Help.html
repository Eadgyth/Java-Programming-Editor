      <h2>Eadgyth help (still in progress)</h2>
      <h4>Requirements</h4>
      <p>The Java runtime environment must be version JRE 8 to run Eadgyth.</P>
      <h4>Configuring a java project</h4>
      <p>It is required that a Java
         development kit (JDK) is installed and the computer is set up to use
         the JDK. For the JDK of Oracle, see:<br>      
      <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html">
      Oracle JDK</a></p>
      <ol>
         <li>Open a java source file or save an unnamed tab as a java source file.
             Only at the first time you will be asked to enter the filepath of
             the JDK.</li>
         <li>Open the settings window using &lsquo;Project settings&rsquo; in the menu
             &lsquo;Project&rsquo;.</li>
         <li>Enter the name of the source file that contains the main method in the text
             field &lsquo;Name of main program file&rsquo; (without extension).</li>
         <li>If this file is within a package enter the package name in the text field
             &lsquo;Package with main class&rsquo;. If it is located in a sub-package
             enter the path with normal file separators (slash in Windows).</li>
         <li>A separate directory for source files (or packages) may be entered in the text
             field &lsquo;Sources directory&rsquo;.</li>
         <li>A separate destination directory for compiled class files maybe entered in the
             text field &lsquo;Executables directory&rsquo; (the folder will be created
             during compilation).</li>
         <li>Click ok. If entries are correct the project can be viewed in the &lsquo;Project
             explorer&rsquo; that is opened in the &lsquo;View&rsquo; menu</li>
         <li>Compile the source file(s) using &lsquo;Save all and compile&rsquo; in the
             &lsquo;Project&rsquo; menu. If errors occur you will be asked to open the
             console to view messages.</li>
         <li>Run the project using &lsquo;Run&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Project&rsquo; menu (this
             will also open the console panel).</li>
         <li>A jar file may be created by using &lsquo;Build&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Project&rsquo;
             menu.</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Further options</h5>
      <ul>
         <li>Arguments for a start script may be entered in the text field &lsquo;Arguments&rsquo;
             (separated by single spaces).</li>
         <li>The name of a build file (jar file in the case of java) can be specified in the field
             &lsquo;Name for jar file&rsquo;. If the field is not filled, the jar name is the name of
             the java file that contains the main method.</li>
         <li>The project can be changed by opening a file that does not belong to the current project.
         <li>An existing project configuration will be retrieved upon opening any file of a project
             previously worked on.</li>
         <li>A project maybe also defined for a txt file (which only allows viewing files in the project
             explorer) or for a HTML file which can be shown in Web browser using &lsquo;Run&rsquo; in
             the &lsquo;Project&rsquo; menu. The keyword coloring for html code is rudimentary though.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Using the console</h4>
      <p>The console area shall show messages after compilation of a project and the output of a program
      that was started as in step 9 (see above). Interactive programs can be run too, but it is not clear
      yet if this works in all situations.</p>
      <p>In addition, self-chosen system commands entered in a dialogue maybe run in the current working
      directory (the root directory of a project). For example, a created jar file may be tested by the
      command java -jar SomeProgram.jar. A run process can be forcibly quit using the &lsquo;stop&rsquo;
      button.</p>
      <p> Note that the term &lsquo;system command&rsquo; does not mean that it is possible to run
      directly terminal commands. While it is possible to run the terminal in the console (by using the
      system command that starts the terminal) a program thereupon started from this terminal cannot be
      forcibly quit using the &lsquo;stop&rsquo; button.</p>
      <h5>To run a system command...</h5>
      <ol>
         <li>Open the console panel in the menu &lsquo;View&rsquo;.</li>
         <li>Press the button &lsquo;Cmd...&rsquo; and enter a command in the shown dialog window. Click
             ok in the dialog window to run the command.</li>
         <li>To run a previous command press the &lsquo;>&rsquo; button; to change a command open the
             command dialog again by pressing the &lsquo;Cmd...&rsquo; button.
      </ol>
      <h5>Further options</h5>
      <ul>
         <li>A new instance of Eadgyth can be run from the console by pressing the button with Eadgyth icon.
             One reason to do this would be to view the output from a tested new plugin.</li>
      </ul>
